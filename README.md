## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**:
  - **Technical Agent**: Analyzes price action, moving averages (SMA_50, SMA_200), RSI, and Golden Crosses.
  - **Fundamental Agent**: Acts as a **Venture Capitalist**, evaluating financial health, P/E ratios, and growth potential.
  - **Sentiment Agent**: Scrapes news and measures market sentiment using AI.
  - **Quant Agent**: Calculates risk metrics like ATR, Stop-Loss, Take-Profit, and Portfolio Allocation.
  - **Consensus Agent**: Acts as an **Alpha Fund Manager**, synthesizing all reports into a final "Investment Committee Decision".

- **Modes**:
  1.  **Single Stock Analysis**: Deep dive into a specific ticker (e.g., THYAO.IS).
  2.  **Growth Hunter (Scanner)**: Scans ~50 stocks (BIST 30 + Growth/Energy) for high-potential breakouts (Volume, Momentum, Volatility).
  3.  **Trade Memory**: Automatically saves analysis reports to a local SQLite database for historical review.

- **AI Powered**: Powered by Google's **Gemini 1.5 Flash / Flash-Lite** models for fast and cost-effective reasoning.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with **Streamlit** for a modern, dark-mode friendly dashboard.
